## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- A Gemini API key from Google AI Studio

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/paradox.git
   cd paradox
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Gemini API key:
   ```bash
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## How It Works

### Conversation Flow
1. User selects a mood/personality for the AI
2. System initializes a chat session with the selected mood's system instructions
3. User sends messages through the terminal-style interface
4. AI generates contextually appropriate responses based on the selected mood
5. Conversation history is maintained with smart context management
6. Escape detection provides thoughtful farewell messages

### AI Mood System
- **Default**: Thoughtful conversation companion for deep discussions
- **Debate**: Socratic dialogue partner for intellectual challenges
- **Conspiracy**: Creative conspiracy theorist with wild theories
- **Dad Jokes**: Pun-loving comedian with wholesome humor
- **Mehfil**: Poetic and romantic soul with Hindi-Urdu expressions
