2. **Get Your Key**: Visit [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev) to get a free API key
3. **Configure**: Click "CONFIGURE API KEY" and enter your key
4. **Manage**: Access API settings anytime via the "API" button in the top-right corner

**Features:**
- âœ… Real-time API key validation
- âœ… Secure local storage (never sent to our servers)
- âœ… Switch between personal and default keys
- âœ… User-friendly error handling
- âœ… No technical setup required

### Option B: Environment Variable (For Developers)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Getting Your Gemini API Key

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Navigate to "Get API key"
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key (starts with "AIzaSy...")
6. Use it in the application

**Privacy Note:** Your API key is stored locally in your browser and never transmitted to our servers.

## How It Works

### Conversation Flow
1. User selects a mood/personality for the AI
2. System initializes a chat session with the selected mood's system instructions
3. User sends messages through the terminal-style interface

5. Conversation history is maintained with smart context management
6. Escape detection provides thoughtful farewell messages
